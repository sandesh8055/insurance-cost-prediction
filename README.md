📌 Project Title

Cost Prediction & Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning

🧠 Business Problem

In real-world operations, organizations need to estimate future costs accurately in order to:

Plan budgets

Manage risk

Optimize operational decisions

This project focuses on predicting individual-level costs using historical data and identifying key cost-driving factors that influence outcomes.

🎯 Objective

Predict cost values using machine learning regression models

Identify critical features impacting cost

Provide data-driven insights that support better business decisions

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized records with attributes such as:

Demographics (age, gender)

Lifestyle indicators

Risk-related variables

Historical cost values

This structure closely resembles real operational and financial datasets used in industries such as insurance, healthcare, and transportation.

🔍 Approach & Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding data distribution

Identifying correlations and trends

Detecting outliers and anomalies

Data Preprocessing

Handling categorical variables

Feature scaling where required

Train–test split

Model Development

Linear Regression

Regularized regression models (if applicable)

Performance comparison using evaluation metrics

Model Evaluation

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

📈 Key Insights

Certain factors have a disproportionate impact on cost, making them critical for forecasting

Simple, interpretable models can often perform competitively with complex approaches

Feature understanding is as important as prediction accuracy

💡 Business Value

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to:

Forecast costs before they occur

Support risk-aware planning

Improve decision-making in operational environments

The same approach can be adapted for:

Operational cost forecasting

Resource planning

Risk analysis in transport and logistics environments

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📌 Conclusion

This project reflects a practical, business-oriented application of machine learning, emphasizing clarity, interpretability, and real-world relevance rather than purely academic modeling.
